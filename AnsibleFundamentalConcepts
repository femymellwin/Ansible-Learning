 Components of Ansible Server:
        > config file [/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg]
        > Seeded inventory file [/etc/ansible/hosts] - This is also called as Host inventory file
        > Custom inventory file [This file can be kept in any location, provided aisble should have access to read the file]  - This is also called as Host inventory file
  
  Seeded / Custom inventory file:
    > hostgroup
    > "all" - This implies all the servers in the inventory file
 
  How we will qualify Ansible Server:
    1- Ansible Server to be installed
    2- A common user to be created to communicate with Managed Hosts. For example jenkins
  
  Pre-requisite:
  SSH Passwordless connection from Ansible Server to Managed Host
  
  Minimum infra requirement:
  Ansible Server & atleast one managed host
  
  > IP address or qualified hostname needed to talk to Managed host
  
  How we will implenent SSH passwordless connect?
  > Using ssh-keygen
  
 Adhoc Commands:
 The Ad-Hoc command is the "one-liner" ansible command that performs one task on the target host
 
 ping:
 ansible <ipaddress> -m ping
 
     Output 1:
       <ip address>  | SUCCESS => {
          "ansible_facts": {
              "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
          },
          "changed": false,
          "ping": "pong"
      }
      
     Example for adhoc command with custom inventory file:
     
     ansible 129.146.81.168 -i inv.txt -m ping

      
      Output 2:
            <ip address>  | UNREACHABLE! => {
          "changed": false,
          "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: connect to host 158.101.31.163 port 22: Connection timed out",
          "unreachable": true
      }

 Ansible Playbook:
 Combining more than one task/Plays
